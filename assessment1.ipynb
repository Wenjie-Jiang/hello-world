        "# Read the notes - Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: Recognition Using Class Specific Linear Projection\n",
        "##Introduction \n",
        "##Content \n",
        "In the modern information age, research on biological characteristics has become more and more important, and human information has become more and more valuable. It can be used for security and important social issues. Therefore, identification and authentication methods have evolved into the main technologies in various fields, such as entrance control of buildings and access control of computers. Face recognition has a high recognition rate for massive face databases with good posture and illumination conditions. It can be used to replace low security requirements and can be successfully applied to different environments such as multimedia. Since Woody Bledsoe and two other researchers conducted their first computer-based face recognition studies in 1964 and 1965, many ways have been taken to identify faces. This article examines a face recognition algorithm that is insensitive to illumination changes. The article solves the problem of Face Recognition. This article is a face recognition technology based on dimensionality reduction: Fisher Faces algorithm. The algorithm is based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Principal component analysis found a linear combination of features with the largest total variance in the data. This is a very powerful method of representing data that is not affected by photosensitivity. Although it is similar to a feature face, it enhances the classification of different image categories. The Fisherface method proposed by the author can be insensitive to changes in illumination (light intensity, number of light sources and changes in direction) and facial expression changes. And compare four methods: Correlation, Eigenfaces, Linear Subspaces, Fisherfaces their respective strengths and weaknesses.  \n",
        "##Innovation \n",
        "The research content of this article is to use a set of labeled face images, the learning set training set; there is also a set of unmarked face images that need to be identified, ie the test set; all face categories in the test set are from the training set. Researchers need to design algorithms to determine which category the test set images belong to. Suppose these face images are already aligned. \n",
        "The innovation of this article is that the researchers describe a new method of facial recognition - insensitive to large changes in lighting. Illumination variability includes not only intensity, but also the direction and quantity of light. The authors found through research that the same person, the same facial expression, from the same point of view, when the light source is illuminated, they will look very different.\n",
        "The article also found some problems through comparison: For example, how does the performance of the Fisherface method extend to large databases? Current face detection methods are likely to decompose under extreme lighting conditions, so new detection methods are needed. When shadows dominate, performance degradation may be desirable for all presented recognition methods and models or masks of technical shadow regions. Researchers are investigating image conditions that represent a model's ability to send a set of objects under all possible illumination, and show that the n-pixel set of objects of any shape and the age of any reflection are seen in all possible lighting conditions. It seems that this raised illumination cone is close to the low dimensional linear subspace. \n",
        "##Technical quality \n",
        "The technical quality of this paper is relatively strong, it describes four face recognition algorithms. The researchers have shown through a large number of experimental results that the error rate of the proposed \"Fisherfaces\" technology is lower than that of the feature face. First, the researchers choose the Correlation method. Correlation is the simplest strategy in the nearest neighbors algorithm. First, the normalization process is performed on all the images, and then the distance between the test image and each image in the learning set is calculated; the labeled face image closest to the test image is found, and the label of this image is regarded as the category of the test image. The disadvantage of this method is that the lighting conditions cause the pictures that originally belong to the same face to be far apart, and the distance calculation is expensive. In view of the shortcomings of Correlation, the researchers used the strategy of dimension reduction, so there is the Eigenfaces method. In this approach, the researchers used m-dimensional data representations to maximize the dispersion of images in all learning sets, namely all images in all classes. However, it should be noted that there are two sources of difference scatter between pictures, one is the between-class scatter, which helps to classify; the other is within-class scatter, which does not help classification. The next Fisherfaces method takes this into account. The Fisherfaces method attempts to correct the form of scatter so that it better represents the difference between images within classes rather than within classes. From the rigor of research, this paper is considered more comprehensive. Emphasis is placed on face recognition algorithms that are insensitive to illumination.\n",
        "##Application and X-factor \n",
        "I think that the application domain is suitable for the technology highlighted in the text - Fisherfaces, but from the research results, the Fisherfaces are disadvantageous. Its main drawback is that it is found that the projection of the face space is more complicated than the feature surface. Calculating the ratio of inter-class scattering to intra-class scattering requires a large amount of processing time. In addition, because of the need for better classification, the projection dimension is larger than the feature surface representation and the storage cost is higher, so a longer recognition time is required.\n",
        "##Presentation \n",
        "This paper is advisable in the way of presentation. Most of the articles are experimentally explored, which is more convincing. The professionalism of this paper is unquestionable, but the arguments and depth of the article are not very clear. The argument explored in this article are not clear enough for non-IT professionals.\n",
        "After each experiment, the researcher will summarize the experiment, for example, the advantages and disadvantages of the experiment, where the experiment is applicable, and not applicable in those places. A comparative study of these face recognition algorithms emphasizes the face recognition algorithm used for illumination insensitivity.\n",
